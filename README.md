## Hello Hexo

On 16th April 2018, I begin using Hexo to build my blog.

Hexo is a powerful blog framework, I can easily write anything about machine learning and my life in markdown, then just do `hexo g` and `hexo d` to generate and deploy my blog to lxsbit.github.io.

Also, I have a domain name which is [liuxsh.com](http://liuxsh.com/), so I just link it to Github pages with Advanced DNS (Don't forget to create the CNAME file in Github).

Well, hope I can write something others would like to read.

Thank you for visiting my Blog.
